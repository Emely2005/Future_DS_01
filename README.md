# Future_DS_01

This repository contains my Data Science & Analytics Task 1 completed during my internship at Future Interns. The objective of the project was to analyze real-world e-commerce sales data and build an interactive business dashboard to support data-driven decision-making.

The project focuses on understanding sales performance, cancellations, customer behavior, product trends, and revenue distribution across time and regions.
